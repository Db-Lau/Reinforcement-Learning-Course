# Reinforcement-Learning-Course
This repository contains codes I have been developing during the course of [Reinforcement Learning from Ã–rebro University](https://www.oru.se/utbildning/kurser/kurs/reinforcement-learning-del-1-dt707a) in Autumn 2021. 

It includes codes for several groups of reinforcement learning algorithms (Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo method and Temporal-difference learning). They are written based on the pseudo codes from [Sutton's book](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).

They are currently applicable to the Cliff-Walking environment in OpenAI GYM, and will be further modified to be applicable to differnt environments.

- TODO: REFACTORING CODE
- TODO: MODIFY CODES TO BE APPLICABLE TO ALL ENVIRONMENTS
